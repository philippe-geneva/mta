<h2>What is an MTA?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-an-mta" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A  Material Transfer Agreements (MTA) is a contract governing the transfer of materials between two organizations. It defines the rights of the provider and the recipient with respect to the materials and any derivatives. MTAs can help to ensure a common understanding as to what is being shared, for what purpose, and how it can be used. MTAs regularly govern the transfer of biological materials, such as samples but can also cover associated data, such meta data or the clinical state of the donor.</p>
<p>For an introduction to MTAs see: ‘Material Transfer Agreements: A Multipurpose Tool for International Cooperation. &lt;<a class="reference external" href="https://sea-eu.net/object/document/117/attach/MTA_final.pdf">https://sea-eu.net/object/document/117/attach/MTA_final.pdf</a>&gt;’</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-use-an-mta">
<h2>Why use an MTA?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-use-an-mta" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A prompt response to a public health emergency can depend upon the ability to move relevant samples and associated data from one place to another. The movement of such samples and associated data must be as simple and transparent as possible, whilst protecting the interests of the owners of the samples and associated data. Increasing awareness of the potential value of certain samples and associated data has increased the demand for these protections.</p>
<p>MTAs play an important role in enabling transfers and subsequent use by the recipient, whilst protecting the interests of the transferee. For a summary of why these agreements are important and a discussion of some of the challenges in using them see: ‘Science Commons: Material Transfer Agreement Project. &lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/ITGG.2007.2.3.137">http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/ITGG.2007.2.3.137</a>&gt;’</p>
<p>MTAs are frequently entered into to provide clarity in terms of the parties’ expectations. Equally important, they provide a written record of the provenance of the materials. Further, in the case of infectious diseases and hazardous materials, they will assist in setting out parties’ expectations about liability and who is responsible for particular risks that may arise during the course of using the material.</p>
<p>Ultimately a decision must be made about whether the objective for the MTA process is to make it smooth, fast and efficient; or to ensure that it is maximally beneficial to those who most need it. While objectives for an MTA will differ widely, the best outcome will take both goals into account and create a balance that responds to different needs and communities.</p>
<p>Recent public health emergencies of international concern (PHEICs) with Ebola virus disease in West Africa and zika virus in Latin America have demonstrated the many difficulties of negotiating MTAs in an emergency context, and showed a clear need for agreed fundamental principles and scalable, sustainable approaches for MTA negotiation (for more information see: Overarching Principles) .</p>

<div class="section" id="when-might-an-mta-be-necessary">
<h2>When might an MTA be necessary?<a class="headerlink" href="#when-might-an-mta-be-necessary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of scenarios where an MTA might help clarify conditions associated with the movement or use of samples and associated data. These might include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Export or international movement of samples and associated data;</li>
<li>Domestic movement of samples and associated data to a separate legal entity
(or in some cases perhaps even for different parts of the same legal entity);</li>
<li>Determining the eventual use or further distribution of samples and associated
data shared for one purpose but with the potential for additional uses;</li>
<li>Uses or purposes where there are specific rules or regulations, or when a third
party, such as a government agency such as a Ministry of Health, is (or needs to
be) involved;</li>
<li>Where the material being moved has a potentially important intrinsic value
(either the material itself or the possibility of using it in other processes or
for product development); and</li>
<li>As part of larger overarching agreements, such as research protocols or
bilateral agreements.</li>
</ul>
<p>MTAs can be very simple documents, or more complex legal agreements. The level of detail may be determined by the potential commercial value of the material being transferred and the intended uses to which it will be put. A discussion of how these agreements might match the details of the transfer see: ‘Use and Misuse of Material Transfer Agreements: Lessons in Proportionality from Research, Repositories, and Litigation &lt;<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4315468/pdf/pbio.1002060.pdf">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4315468/pdf/pbio.1002060.pdf</a>&gt;’.</p>

<h2>MTA’s during public health emergencies<a class="headerlink" href="#mtas-during-public-health-emergencies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>During a public health emergency, it will be important to ensure that samples and associated data can be moved, accessed and used for a variety of important purposes, including the identification and characterization of the responsible pathogen, diagnostic purposes, clinical decision making, epidemiology as well as the development or validation of diagnostic tools. Given the emergency context, it will be desirable to have in place simple and transparent measures that protect the interests of all parties.</p>
<p>During the public consultation on this tool, several respondents noted the absence of a public health-specific overarching international framework governing access to and sharing of samples and associated data from diseases other than influenza. Very different views were expressed as to the desirability or feasibility of developing such a framework. In its absence and given that a prompt response to a public health emergency can depend upon the ability to move relevant samples and associated data from one place to another. The movement of such samples and associated data must be as simple and transparent as possible, whilst protecting the interests of the owners of the samples and associated data.</p>
<p>The tool embraces views expressed by many of those involved in its development of the importance of continuing to work towards the “broader public good”. In a public health context, this will involve both the shorter-term goals of preventing the spread of disease and reducing mortality and morbidity, and longer-term goals of preventing future outbreaks and building capacity to mitigate their impact. Some comments received during the public consultation highlighted possible differences in understanding of the meaning of a broader public good and the challenges of accomplishing this in the presence of commercial and self-interests.</p>
<p>In the early days of an emergency, it will likely be government representatives who are signing agreements to transfer materials. Governments will likely be unable – and unwilling – to negotiate commercial terms that apply to future, potentially unknown, commercial actors. Furthermore, there aren’t necessarily existing researchers/manufacturers working with the pathogen of concern with which to negotiate, or any established marketplace for countermeasures that can be used to inform the value of any potential benefits. As a result, even if potential manufacturers are identified and engaged in the negotiations, they’re unlikely to have a good understanding of their chances of success in developing a countermeasure, their capacity to produce such a product, what the value of that product might be, etc.</p>
<p>The tool is intended for use prior to a public health emergency to build relevant human capacity – not to develop an MTA during such an outbreak.</p>
<p>MTA negotiations are more likely to become protracted where parties perceive a need to protect their own interests and manage risks. Where this is not possible, either because a standard MTA is implemented without change, or because a funding agency or other party (such as a biorepository) uses a standard MTA, the process of transfer is often expedited. There have been attempts to develop model MTAs for use during public health emergencies. For an example of such an approach see the MTA developed by the Global Health Security Initiative: ADD LINK</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="purpose-of-this-tool">
<h2>Purpose of this tool<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose-of-this-tool" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>WHO is constructing a tool to help build human capacity to develop material transfer agreements (MTAs) governing biological samples and associated data connected to severe emerging diseases with potential to generate a public health emergency, and for which no, or insufficient, preventive and curative solutions exist. The tool is intended for use prior to a public health emergency. It is part of broader efforts to build human capacity to manage sample sharing in a manner that ensures the full public health potential of valuable biological material is realized for rapid detection of, and response to public health emergencies. During a public health emergency, transfers covered by MTAs will be important for a variety of important purposes, including the identification and characterization of the responsible pathogen, diagnostic purposes, clinical decision making, epidemiology, the development or validation of diagnostic tools as well as medical countermeasure development.</p>
<p>The tool is not meant to be prescriptive, but rather it is meant to provide users with options and examples of proven solutions and language.</p>
<p>It is not intended to be used to develop an MTA during a public health emergency. There have been attempts to develop model MTAs for use in these circumstances. As one respondent to the public call for comments on this tool noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The tool presents users with an overly broad menu of terms that could be
combined to create a large number of unique MTAs. Combining complex terms in
novel ways will require time-consuming negotiations, which our prior experience
has shown can delay detection or early identification of a potential emergency.
While the menu-based approach may offer value outside of a potential or actual
public health emergency, the tool simply contains unnecessary information to
facilitate the timely sharing of samples.</div></blockquote>
<p>The tool will be accessible to different types of user, including those in health ministries, laboratories or other relevant facilities, as well as those generating samples in the field. It will help users with different levels of experience, from those with little previous exposure to MTAs, through to experts looking for concrete examples of text. The tool will help both those sending and receiving samples and associated data. It will cover the movement samples and associated data for a wide range of purposes, from diagnosis, through to countermeasure research and development.</p>
<p>Efforts to build capacity around sample access, sharing and use complement existing WHO work on data sharing during public health emergencies (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.who.int/blueprint/what/norms-standards/en/">http://www.who.int/blueprint/what/norms-standards/en/</a> ). This tool is intended to focus on physical samples and directly associated data (metadata) – such as where, when and by whom it was taken. It might also encompass clinical information intended to accompany the samples (such as the disease state of the donor). It could usefully link to other data being gathered or used for epidemiological purposes. It is not intended to cover stand-alone data, such as genome sequence data (other than as a derivative of the sample) which would covered by efforts to consider data sharing during public health emergencies, which already advocate that that such information is disseminated rapidly and transparently.</p>

<div class="section" id="cross-cutting-issues">
<h2>Cross-cutting issues<a class="headerlink" href="#cross-cutting-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Overarching Principles</strong></p>
<p>Past discussions have highlighted a number of overarching principles that could usefully be codified in an MTA including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Speed</em> - in a public health emergency rapid action can be critical, making it important that as soon as possible samples and associated data are shared with a suitable reference laboratory and the results made available to those that need to know;</li>
<li><em>Sustainability</em> - the samples and associated data generated by a public health emergency can be important for understanding more about the disease and in developing tools to combat it. These important resources will need to be maintained and managed over the longer term. It will be important to think of how this can be realistically accomplished at the same time as addressing immediate public health needs;</li>
<li><em>Capacity building</em> - public health emergencies pose a collective threat. There remains much to be done to build the core capacities needed to address them effectively. This is an ongoing process requiring continual consideration. Successful capacity building may reduce the need to transport samples and associated data in the future;</li>
<li><em>Maximal preservation</em> - avoiding destruction of potentially useful samples and associated data. These are important biological resources. In some cases, they may be irreplaceable;</li>
<li><em>Trust</em> - It is important that the MTA process establishes a level of trust among the participants where they feel their needs are recognised in the text. This is important also to prevent populations from fearing or misunderstanding research and pushing back; and to prevent stigmatisation of communities. Issues around stigma, violence cannot be ignored.</li>
<li><em>Good faith</em> - prompt responses necessitated by public health emergencies are often not conducive to detailed negotiations, or focus on considerations beyond immediate needs. Addressing longer term arrangements for the samples and associated data may need to happen after the original transfer has been completed. Both parties will need to continue to work towards the broader public good, including through the commensurate sharing of any benefits accrued from sharing samples and associated data;</li>
<li><em>Good practices</em> - it is important that, despite the emergency setting, transfers of samples and associated data follow the highest possible standards, for example taking into account bioethics issues, procedures and practices for safe and secure storage, handling and shipping of materials, and principles for access to genetic resources Exactly which good practices are relevant will likely be context specific; and</li>
<li><em>Consistency with applicable national and international laws</em> - For example, drafting an MTA will likely have to take into account a legal environment composed of both national and international laws. Applicable national laws may be contract laws, rules regarding conflicts of laws, national security laws, biosafety laws, or national access and benefit-sharing measures. Applicable international laws could be instruments such as the International Health Regulations (2005), in particular its Articles 6 and 46, the Convention on Biological Diversity, in particular Article 15 on access to genetic resources, or the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Authorised individuals</strong></p>
<p>It is also important to consider who is signing an agreement. It is important that the individual is empowered to make all the binding commitments the agreement contains. Whilst the Ministry of Health may often play a leading role in developing and agreeing MTAs, many other government departments could be involved in their implementation. For example, an Environment Ministry might have the delegated authority to control the export of biological resources, which can include disease samples and associated data, or the Border Control and Customs agencies may have specific roles to play in allowing samples and associated data to leave the country. It is vital that those ultimately agreeing to MTAs (and the provisions they contain) are ultimately empowered to do so. Equally, the value of greater inter-agency cooperation and coordination should be noted. It may also be useful to include in and MTA appropriate contact points in these other ministries or agencies to assist ensuring the transfer of materials is as simple and smooth as possible.</p>
<p>Depending on the nature of the MTA it may be appropriate for researchers receiving and using materials to sign an undertaking that they understand the obligations contained in the agreement (in addition to a formal representative of the institution/organization). This is essential as they will be responsible for putting the terms of the agreement into effect and are the parties most likely to find themselves (often unknowingly) in breach.</p>
<p><strong>Origin of samples and associated data</strong></p>
<p>It is important to think about how and why the samples and associated data were taken and from whom.</p>
<p>In a public health emergency, samples may have originally been taken from patients for diagnosis and treatment. Informed consent may not have explicitly obtained for the samples’ use or for future use. There are practical challenges in being able to meet requirements for informed consent during a public health emergency, for example, given the psychological impact of an individual fearing that they are infected. Furthermore, obtaining informed consent retroactively would be difficult and costly – recent experiences suggest that samples can become disassociated from patient identifiers or clinical records. Attempting to obtain retroactive consent from individuals may therefore be unfeasible, especially in outbreaks with high levels of mortality. Governments and the public-health community, on the other hand, do have obligations to carry out research that might save lives during future Ebola outbreaks. This research could be significantly aided by making use of these samples. The original of the sample and the conditions under which they are taken might also influence thinking about benefit sharing. There are existing good practices on dealing with such situations included in the Helsinki Declaration. For more information see: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/79(4)373.pdf">http://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/79(4)373.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>Contents of samples and associated data</strong></p>
<p>The likely contents of samples and associated data must also be considered.  Many samples and associated data generated during a public health emergency are unlikely to be isolated pathogens. As a result, relevant samples and associated data will often include elements associated with the host or patient. In the longer run, such material might be of greater value than the pathogen as it could provide insights into the host’s reaction, offering important markers for diagnostics, vaccines or therapeutics.</p>
<p>Furthermore, pathogens are not static. They will continue to mutate and evolve. It will be important to consider in an MTA the possibility of changes in the materials they cover and the scope of the agreement – thereby preventing the need to renegotiate an MTA unnecessarily.</p>
<p><strong>Value of samples</strong></p>
<p>Not all samples are equally valuable - a human sample alone is useful, but a sample linked to clinical data, or part of a series of samples over time, or which is linked with epidemiological data, can be more useful and therefore potentially more valuable. The MTA process should ensure that the greater the cost to the donor, the more benefit they receive. Samples and associated data can also be used in different ways. There is a need to differentiate between different types of outputs which could be generated from the movement of samples and associated data. These include: papers or other academic output; testing or quality assurance (QA) for a product already under development; or use in an unforeseen product, perhaps some time after the material was transferred or in subsequent technical developments. It might not be possible to know the value of a sample and associated data at the outset. This may warrant including provisions to negotiate further use should a sample and associated data prove particularly valuable.</p>
<p>It is important that concepts of value of samples are explicitly addressed and shared amongst those involved with developing an MTA. Some initial thinking on the identification of valuable samples during a public health emergency was undertaken by WHO at its Second Informal Consultation on Biobanking in Sierra Leone in 2015 (for more information see: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.who.int/medicines/ebola-treatment/meetings/2nd_who_biobaking-consultation/en/">http://www.who.int/medicines/ebola-treatment/meetings/2nd_who_biobaking-consultation/en/</a>). Leaving notions of cost and value of samples undefined can create ambiguity, specifically during a public health emergency, and can lead to protracted discussions and delay or hinder the development of vital diagnostics.</p>
<p>It is possible that perceptions of value of samples and associated data can complicate access. It is important samples and associated data can be rapidly accessed, transferred and used for public health purposes (for more information see MTA’s during public health emergencies). As a result, from a public health perspective, it might be advisable not to limit access to samples and associated data on the basis of value during a public health emergency. Discussions over the value of the sample and associated data and any benefits that might therefore need to be shared could be delayed until the emergency has receded. An MTA can be a useful tool for protecting the interest of both parties and for capturing the intent to return to this issue in good faith after the emergency is over.</p>
<p>As one responder during the public consultation on this tool noted, attaching value to medical samples “risks promoting a view that biological materials necessary for public health responses are commodities that can and should be bargained for. Further, such competition may result in uncertain and unequal outcomes depending on the scarcity of the samples.  For materials in short supply, affected countries may be incentivized to “hold out for a better deal.” For widely available materials, affected countries may be forced into a “race to the bottom” to accept less generous terms for fear of getting no benefit at all.”</p>
<p><strong>Prioritizing work</strong></p>
<p>Samples from a public health emergency can be a valuable resource in improving our understanding of the diseases involved and in developing tools and technologies for use in future outbreaks. There are often also only limited amounts of samples available for such work. There will be many uses to which these samples might be put but given their finite nature, some system of prioritizing work may be necessary. Consideration may need to be given to who can decide upon the ‘best’ use of available samples and associated materials.</p>
<p>In some cases, there may be coordinated, international efforts to structure this discussion. For example, during the EVD PHEIC in West Africa WHO convened the Ebola Science Committee which brought together expertise in virology, epidemiology, clinical and behavioural science, mathematical modelling, and science and public health policy, and worked with the Ministries of Health from particularly affected countries and representatives from survivor networks to produce a prioritized research agenda. This focused on ‘basic’ as opposed to ‘applied’ research. For more information see: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.who.int/medicines/ebola-treatment/WHO_ebola-science-committee-research-agenda.pdf?ua=1">http://www.who.int/medicines/ebola-treatment/WHO_ebola-science-committee-research-agenda.pdf?ua=1</a></p>
<p>When considering the use or further use of samples and associated data to be covered by an MTA, it may be useful to refer or reference such research agendas. If no structured approach exists, it may be necessary for parties to an MTA to consider what types of work they consider to be the most important for the samples and associated data being transferred.</p>
<p><strong>Potential for commercial development</strong></p>
<p>While in emergencies it is admirable to want to share information and samples, if commercial entities are involved it is unclear how willing they might be to do so.</p>
<p>During the development of this tool, some have suggested that MTAs for use in emergencies may benefit from a non-commercial model – where the material is transferred for specific public health purposes, such as pathogen identification or characterization. Any subsequent commercial use, such as the development of vaccines and therapeutics, would require additional negotiation, possibly after the emergency is over. It was also noted that some institutions may be restricted by pre-existing commitments to funders or commercial partners on these issues. A suggestion received during the public consultation on this tool was to encourage the inclusion in future MTAs of a standard clause allowing material to be shared between associated parties in the case of a severe health emergency. Several participants have suggested that subsequent use other than for commercial development may be more broadly acceptable but it will still necessitate consideration of equitable benefit sharing and compliance with rules over the use of human tissues.</p>
<p>Others have suggested that it may not be useful to differentiate between commercial and non-commercial activities. Some of these concerns about differentiating between the two – noting that non-commercial research can rapidly become part of a commercial activity. Others have questioned  the feasibility of excluding “commercialization” from initial consideration of an MTAs  given recent experiences demonstrating the importance of the participation of commercial actors to develop and mass-produce diagnostics during the emergency period.</p>
<p>Differentiating between “commercial” and “research” uses of material may not be feasible in complex public-private product development systems such as those that commonly exist in the United States. For example, “research” conducted by a U.S. academic or government laboratory on a diagnostic product could later have “commercial” potential if licensed to a commercial actor to allow for mass production. In general, it should be determined whether “commercial” and “research” uses can be acceptably differentiated, and, if so, how the differences can be enforced in an MTA.</p>
<p><strong>Provenance of samples</strong></p>
<p>The increasing importance of knowing and demonstrating the chain-of-custody or provenance of material used for commercial development is also important. A well-documented process for the acquisition of material makes commercial sense by demonstrating due diligence and insulating those developing products from later claims contesting ownership.</p>
<p><strong>Third-parties</strong></p>
<p>In some cases it may be desirable to include a suitable third party in MTAs to act as a neutral party to ensure negotiation in good faith and an unbiased implementation.
