A  Material Transfer Agreements (MTA) is a contract governing the transfer of materials between two organizations. It defines the rights of the provider and the recipient with respect to the materials and any derivatives. MTAs can help to ensure a common understanding as to what is being shared, for what purpose, and how it can be used. MTAs regularly govern the transfer of biological materials, such as samples but can also cover associated data, such meta data or the clinical state of the donor.
